# ðŸ“Œ Description

This repo contains weekly practical codes for my **Python for Data Science** course at university.

Here, you can explore various essential skills in using Python for Data Science, tailored for beginners. ðŸš€

- **Lab01 - Basics Syntax**

  ðŸ”¸ An introduction to fundamental Python syntax and libraries, including variables, data types, and essential functions.

  ðŸ”¸ Designed to help beginners get started with Python quickly.

- **Lab02 - AI & Technology Department: Data Scientist Position**

  ðŸ”¸ This lab contains a real-world Data Scientist interview test from a technology company.

  ðŸ”¸ The test includes two main sections:

  - **Statistics & Probability:** Covers key statistical concepts commonly assessed in interviews.
  - **Coding Challenges:** Hands-on Python exercises to evaluate problem-solving and data manipulation skills.

- **Lab03 - Lab03 - Tabular Data Manipulation**

  ðŸ”¸ Working with tabular data using _pandas_, including data processing, descriptive statistics, filtering, and modeling.

  ðŸ”¸ Hands-on practice with datasets to enhance data analysis skills.

- **Lab04 - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

  ðŸ”¸ Understanding Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python: classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

  ðŸ”¸ Applying OOP concepts to _Student Management System_ mini-project.

- **Lab05 - PyTorch for Deep Learning**

  ðŸ”¸ Introduction to PyTorch, a powerful deep learning framework.

  ðŸ”¸ Covers the basics of tensors and using in classification.
  
- **Lab06 - Comprehensive Review**

- **Lab07 - Build Model by Pytorch**
  
  ðŸ”¸ Covers the basics of tensors and building a simple neural network model.

- **Mini-project: AI Engineer**

  ðŸ”¸ LLM integration: Build an AI-powered language translation tool using the Gemini API.

  ðŸ”¸ Chatbot Development: Develop a chatbot that retrieves information from a website.
    - Data Access & Indexing: Crawl the given website, preprocess the content, and create a searchable index for chatbot responses. Use tools like Selenium or Requests for data extraction.
    - Chatbot Implementation: Build an AI-powered chatbot to retrieve relevant information using NLP and similarity metrics.
  
  ðŸ’¡ _A practical project that applies Python, NLP, and web crawling techniques!_
